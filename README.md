# Image-Classification-on-Fashion-Dataset-for-Ecommerce-using-YOLOV8
In this project, a classification model was developed to predict the type of fashion item in an image. The model was trained to distinguish between three categories: t-shirt, shirt, and dress. Utilizing the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) architecture, known for its efficiency and accuracy in object detection and classification tasks, the project aimed to achieve high precision and recall in identifying these fashion items.<br>

Key Components:<br>
<h2>Dataset:</h2><br>

The dataset comprised images of t-shirts, shirts, and dresses. Each image was labeled according to its respective category.
The dataset was preprocessed to ensure uniformity in image size and quality, enhancing the model's training effectiveness.
<h2>Model Architecture:</h2><br>

YOLOv8 was selected for its state-of-the-art performance in real-time object detection and classification.
The architecture was fine-tuned to optimize for the specific task of fashion item classification.
<h2>Training Process:</h2><br>

The model was trained using a labeled dataset, with a split for training, validation to ensure robust performance evaluation.
Various augmentation techniques were applied to increase the dataset's diversity and improve the model's generalization capability.
<h2>Evaluation:</h2><br>

The model's performance was assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Confusion matrices were generated to visualize the model's classification performance across the three categories.
<h2>Deployment:</h2>

The trained model can be integrated into applications such as fashion e-commerce platforms, automated inventory management systems, or mobile apps
